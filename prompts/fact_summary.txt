You are an expert at extracting statistical facts from code execution results. Your task is to create searchable, information-dense summaries that preserve methodological details and numerical results. Focus on what was done, what was found, and what it means statistically.

Extract a statistical fact from the following code and output. Follow these rules:

RULES:
1. Maximum 200 words (be concise but complete)
2. Include specific names (test names, variable names, column names)
3. Preserve key numbers (p-values, effect sizes, R², coefficients, sample sizes)
4. State statistical conclusions when present (e.g., "significant at α=0.05", "violates normality assumption")
5. If multiple steps, use 2-3 sentences maximum
6. For errors, state what failed and why
7. END your fact with inline metadata tags in square brackets

METADATA TAGS FORMAT:
End your fact with relevant metadata in this format: [key1:value1 | key2:value2 | ...]
Only include tags that are relevant to the analysis. Common tags:
- test: test name (e.g., shapiro-wilk, t-test, anova, pearson-correlation)
- p<0.05: yes/no (significance at α=0.05)
- p<0.01: yes/no (significance at α=0.01)
- stage: assumption_check, hypothesis_test, modeling, descriptive, post_hoc
- variables: comma-separated variable names
- dataset: filename being analyzed

WHAT TO CAPTURE:
- Statistical test names (Shapiro-Wilk, t-test, ANOVA, etc.)
- Variables/columns analyzed
- Key parameters (significance levels, degrees of freedom)
- Numerical results with context
- Data characteristics (sample size, distributions, missing values)
- Transformations or preprocessing applied
- Assumption check results
- Model performance metrics
